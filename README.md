Github Early showcases users who starred and watched a Github repo in its earliest stages.

# Github Early

![](./readme/images/show.png)

### What's this for?

> When browsing a sizable Github repository (e.g., [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)), I often wonder about the group of people who showed interest in these potentially groundbreaking projects from the very beginning. These individuals could be friends and colleagues of the project's founders, seasoned professionals within the industry, or ambitious young minds ready to make a mark.

Github Early provides a fresh way to explore Github by displaying the earliest followers (Early Stargazers and Early Watchers) for each Github repository 😄.

### How to Install & Use

1. Install [Github Early](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/github-early/jccgmkepfgemmajbkfiggkjjgkklcpdc) from the Chrome Web Store.

2. Enter your [Github Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
